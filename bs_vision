The VISION 

to creat a simple universal problem solver () 

inputs include the current state space or sub state spcae 
    - think about the possible ways a state space can be represeted 
    ( as a relevant data structure of (atomic possible states))
inputs include a atomic GOAL state in valid to the state space / universe 
    ( as a atomic required goal or set of accepted atomic instance )
inputs include all applicable rules to the universe 
    (as a possible pointer to the same function , returns true if rule is applicable and vice versa (inputs to this fuction will the identefier for the rule))
    (this pointed function should be a rule switcher which rules are identified by)
    // study about pointers to funcitons in c++
inputs include a heuristic funciton which evaluates satates potential
    (as a pointer to the same funcions (inputs the fucntion is an atomic state) )
